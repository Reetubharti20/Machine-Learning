such as trading volume, market indices, and economic indicators.
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering:Identify and engineer relevant features that may influence stock prices,
including technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) and external factors (e.g., market trends, news sentiment).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Conduct a thorough exploratory analysis to identify patterns, trends, 
and correlations in the stock price data, helping to inform model selection and feature importance.

Develop and fine-tune deep learning models to predict Zomato’s stock prices based on historical data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of different models using appropriate metrics 
(e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared) and validation techniques (e.g., train-test split, 
cross-validation) to ensure robust forecasting capabilities.

Generate stock price forecasts for Zomato and visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices to provide 
intuitive insights into the model’s performance.
